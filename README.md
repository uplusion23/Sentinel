## Introduction

> Sentinel is a small project to bring the experience of online DnD tools into one package that works seamlessly together. Generate custom maps with political regions, cities, towns, harbors, with population, trade routes, rivers and mountain ranges. Your characters can be uploaded from multiple online character sheets, and managed all within the application, or you can create entirely new characters. Manage dice rolling and lore within the app, too, and everything is saved so it can be ready to be opened next time you play.

#### Bugs
* All of them

#### Dev Build Setup/Installation
1. Install NodeJS (I use **v6.11.2** for development)
2. Download a copy of the Node-Webkit Javascript SDK (https://nwjs.io) I use **v0.24.4**
3. `git clone` or download a `.zip` of the repo, and extract the contents to a folder.
4. Extract the `nwjs.zip` to a `bin` folder within the app folder.
4a. The path should be as follows `/sentinelfolder/bin/` with `nw.exe` inside the bin folder
5. Run the app using the start.bat file. There will be an official launcher later on.


#### Issues?
* Ensure the nodejs modules are updated via `npm update` command.
* Ensure you are running the 64bit nodejs, and NWJS
